# CC-SVC (Claude Code Service)

A service that wraps the Claude Agent SDK to provide HTTP streaming endpoints for Claude Code interactions with MCP server support and session resumption.

> **Note:** This service has been migrated to use **Bun** as the runtime and package manager. See the [root README](../../README.md) for mono-repo setup and Bun workspace information.
